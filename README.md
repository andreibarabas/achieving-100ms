## Why 100ms?

`100ms` is the Holy Grail of product development, as it provides the ultimate experience for people using it.

According to the [Usability Engineering Study (1993)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/), `100ms` is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is `reacting instantaneously`, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.

Bellow you can find a list of tips & tricks that can help you achieve that goal.
